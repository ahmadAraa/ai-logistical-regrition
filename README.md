# Student Performance Prediction Using Linear Regression

This project analyzes a Students Performance dataset and applies a Linear Regression model to predict students' GPA based on academic, parental, and socioeconomic factors.

The objective of the project is to explore the relationships between different features and student performance, and to build a simple predictive model using basic machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

The project follows a complete data analysis and machine learning workflow, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

It was developed as part of an academic coursework to demonstrate fundamental concepts in data analysis and supervised learning.

---

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains information related to students, such as:
- Academic performance indicators
- Parental education and support
- Socioeconomic attributes
- Grade Point Average (GPA), which is used as the target variable

Correlation analysis was used to identify features with strong influence on GPA.

## Methodology

The following steps were performed in this project:

1. Data loading and inspection  
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
4. Correlation matrix analysis  
5. Feature selection by removing weakly correlated variables  
6. Train-test split  
7. Model training using Linear Regression  
8. Model evaluation and result interpretation
